''' Module for the island_perimeter '''


def island_perimeter(grid):
    '''
    The function calculates the perimeter of an island.
    0- represents a water zone
    1- represents a land zone
    One cell is a square with side length 1
    Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally)
    Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100

    Args:
        grid: lists of lists
    Return:
